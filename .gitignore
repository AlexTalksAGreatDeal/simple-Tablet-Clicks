#from http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/69609-Source-Control-w-Free-Unity-ignore-files-%28Git-SVN-CVS%29
#UPDATE: I assumed it would work for SVN and CVS
#but dreamora pointed out that they would have issues
#We use Git and currently have had no issues
#Git is also Rad, I dont use SVN or CVS anymore unless I'm forced.

#this is the git ignore file if you want to use the free Unity
# the ! negates an ignore, so you ignore everything in Library then
#un-ignore the metadata folder and those specific files
#use at your own risk.

#NOTE: this will cause your collaborators to re-import assets
# (previews and cache), but it seems to have no value to keep in source control
